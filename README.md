These are two, initially separate projects, merged together. The purpose of the first one was to develop a JS/JQuery front end interface that works with provided server using Ajax and JSON. The purpose of the second project was to write such a server.

- Maven is used to manage dependencies.
- Javascript and JQuery application is responsible for user interface.
- Ajax GET, POST, PUT and DELETE requests are used to communicate with server. Book data is in JSON format.
- Spring MVC mock-up server implements CRUD model to store book data in HashMap and handle requests.
